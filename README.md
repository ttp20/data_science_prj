### Introduction
This is my first data science project. After having a basic grasp of Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, which are indispensable tools for perfoming a variety of data science tasks with Python, I decided to do this project to further solidify my skills.

This project is mainly concerned with doing some elementary data analysis on the results of 74000 students' from the National High School Exam in 2020 at Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam.

### Project Description

1. Data Collection - How did I manage to get this dataset ?

You can view an exam taker's results at 'diemthi.hcm.edu.vn' by entering their id number which has the format '020xxxxx' where xxxxx runs from 00001 to 74171. To retrieve this data (in HTML form) and display it on a Python terminal I used this command "curl -F"



### Launch
***
You do not have to do anything. Just simply go to data_analysis folder and look at 'data_analysis.ipynb'
